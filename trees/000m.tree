\title{Exponential Blow up problem}

\p{
  When converting a formula to Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF) or Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF), the size of the resulting formula can grow exponentially in the worst case. This is known as the \strong{exponential blow up problem}. For example, a formula with #{n} variables can result in a DNF or CNF with up to #{2^n} clauses.

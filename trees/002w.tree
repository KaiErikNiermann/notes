\title{Full and faithful functors}

\p{We consider a [functor](002v) between two [(locally small)](002o) categories #{F : C \to D}. For each pair of objects #{X, Y \in \mathrm{Ob}(C)} the functor induces a function between hom-sets:}
##{
  F_{X, Y} : C(X, Y) \to D(F(X), F(Y))
}
\p{We can describe functors based on the properties of these induced functions as follows:}
\ul{
  \li{The functor #{F} is called \strong{faithful} if for every pair of objects #{X, Y \in \mathrm{Ob}(C)} the function #{F_{X, Y}} is injective. We can also denote this as:
  ##{
    (x \xrightarrow{f} y) \mapsto (F(x) \xrightarrow{F(f)} F(y))
  }
  or using the notation of an embedding as:
  ##{
    C(X, Y) \hookrightarrow D(F(X), F(Y))
  }
  An important note to make here is that a faithful functor only presereves distinctness of morphisms, so what this means is that:
  \blockquote{
    no two different arrows with the same domain and codomain in #{C} are mapped to (or get identified by) the same arrow in #{D}
  }
  It \strong{does not} say
    \ul{
      \li{different objects in #{C} are mapped to different objects in #{D}.}
      \li{two morphisms with different domains/codomains in #{C} are mapped to different morphisms in #{D}.}
  }
  So in a diagrammatic sense a faithful functor essentially guarantees this:

      & {F(X)} && {F(Y)} \\
      \\
      X && Y
      \arrow[""{name=0, anchor=center, inner sep=0}, "{F(f)}", curve={height=-18pt}, from=1-2, to=1-4]
      \arrow[""{name=1, anchor=center, inner sep=0}, "{F(g)}", curve={height=18pt}, from=1-2, to=1-4]
      \arrow[dashed, from=3-1, to=1-2]
      \arrow[""{name=2, anchor=center, inner sep=0}, "f", curve={height=-18pt}, from=3-1, to=3-3]
      \arrow[""{name=3, anchor=center, inner sep=0}, "g", curve={height=18pt}, from=3-1, to=3-3]
      \arrow[dashed, from=3-3, to=1-4]
      \arrow[between={0.2}{0.8}, dashed, from=3, to=1]
      \arrow[between={0.2}{0.8}, dashed, from=2, to=0]
    \end{tikzcd}\]
  }
  \li{The functor #{F} is called \strong{full} if for every pair of objects #{X, Y \in \mathrm{Ob}(C)} the function #{F_{X, Y}} is surjective. Likewise here its important to note that
  \blockquote{
    a full functor only guarantees that any morphism between two objects in the image of #{F} comes from a morphism in #{C}
  }
  It \strong{does not} say
  \ul{
    \li{every object in #{D} is in the image of #{F}. In other words objects in #{D} outside the image of #{F} may not have any preimage in #{C}.}
    \li{every morphism with a domain/codomain outside the image of #{F} comes from a morphism in #{C}. Similarly morphisms between objects in the image of #{F} may not have a preimage in #{C}.}
    }
  We can again demonstrate this diagrammatically as follows:
  \texfig{
    % https://q.uiver.app/#q=WzAsNCxbMCwyLCJYIl0sWzIsMiwiWSJdLFsyLDAsIkYoWCkiXSxbNCwwLCJGKFkpIl0sWzAsMSwiZiJdLFsyLDMsIkYoZikiXSxbMCwyLCIiLDEseyJzdHlsZSI6eyJib2R5Ijp7Im5hbWUiOiJkYXNoZWQifX19XSxbMSwzLCIiLDEseyJzdHlsZSI6eyJib2R5Ijp7Im5hbWUiOiJkYXNoZWQifX19XSxbNCw1LCIiLDAseyJzaG9ydGVuIjp7InNvdXJjZSI6MjAsInRhcmdldCI6MjB9LCJsZXZlbCI6MSwic3R5bGUiOnsiYm9keSI6eyJuYW1lIjoiZGFzaGVkIn19fV1d
  \[\begin{tikzcd}
    && {F(X)} && {F(Y)} \\
    \\
    X && Y
    \arrow[""{name=0, anchor=center, inner sep=0}, "{F(f)}", from=1-3, to=1-5]
    \arrow[dashed, from=3-1, to=1-3]
    \arrow[""{name=1, anchor=center, inner sep=0}, "f", from=3-1, to=3-3]
    \arrow[dashed, from=3-3, to=1-5]
    \arrow[between={0.2}{0.8}, dashed, from=1, to=0]
  \end{tikzcd}\]
  }
  The main idea being that a full functor only guarantees that if we have some arrow between two objects in the image (application) of #{F} then there exists some preimage arrow in #{C} that maps to it. But we can have objects and morphisms outside the image of #{F} that do not have any preimage in #{C}.
  }
  In other words it \strong{does not mean} the functor is \em{surjective on objects} or \em{morphisms} in general.
  }
  \li{The functor #{F} is called \strong{fully faithful} if for every pair of objects #{X, Y \in \mathrm{Ob}(C)} the function #{F_{X, Y}} is bijective. We say that a fully faithful functor is necessarily injective on objects up to [isomorphism](002s), that is assuming #{F} is fully faithful then we have:
    ##{
      F(X) \cong F(Y) \implies X \cong Y
    }
  This means that if two objects in the image of #{F} are isomorphic then their preimages in #{C} must also be isomorphic. In other words what this means is that a fully faithful functor preserves distinctness of objects up to the point of being the same for all practical purposes (i.e. isomorphism).
